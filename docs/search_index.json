Before you start :   Move between pages by using the left or right arrows, or by using the table of contents on the left.  Allow 3 to 4 hours of reading time if you want to read everything in detail. Happy reading ! Introduction Our modern lives put us in constant contact with information. So much information that it can be very difficult to structure it, but also to find it. Different softwares exist today to lighten the work that we ask our brains to manage this information. However, these programs are often owned by large corporations that are unclear about whether they have access to the stored data, and whether they share it with other companies or intelligence agencies. They also have methods or workings that are sometimes very rigid, and that may not be suitable for you. However, it is possible to take advantage of the good sides of technology to be able to navigate this ocean of information, without compromising your privacy. This is the goal of this workshop, which will present you different free and open-source software. These will help you better manage the information you encounter on a daily basis, while having control over your data. It will also introduce you to different methods of organizing information to help you better manage it, by taking advantage of the different software you will discover. The purpose of this workshop is not to present a rigid methodology that you should follow at all costs. This workshop is here to encourage you to discover and experiment, with one important caveat: remember that the perfect solution does not exist, and that experimentation can be exhausting if it is done for too long. Trust yourself, and give yourself time to try a system for a while before trying to change it! Objectives of the workshop Discover and learn to use the basic functions of the following software :  Joplin  Zotero  Nextcloud Learn how to use these different software programs together to manage information using the following methods :  The Zettelkasten method  The P.A.R.A method  The inbox method Presenter Clément Hardy I am a PhD student in forest ecology, under the supervision of Elise Filotas and Christian Messier. Passionate about open-source software and organization methods, I decided to set up this workshop to share my little knowledge on the subject. "],["01-software.html", "Open-source software to get organized", " Open-source software to get organized We will start by discovering different software that makes it easy to get organized. All of these softwares are open-source (their source code, and thus their functioning, is visible to everyone). They are also free (no subscription, purchase, or other). However, they require a little time to install and get used to them, which is why this workshop will try to make easier for you. "],["02-joplin.html", "Joplin", " Joplin Joplin is a note-taking application with many features. It is an open-source and completely free software that allows you to create notes in the Markdown writing language, and to organize them in notebooks, and associate them with tags. It is an excellent alternative to software such as Evernote or Microsoft One Note. Joplin Features Joplin makes organization much easier, replacing in one place any need for post-its, notebooks or task lists. In particular, Joplin allows you to: Gather all your written or graphic information in one place: your class notes, your thoughts, your projects, your recipes, your shopping lists, your to-do lists, etc. Find all this information very quickly (in a few seconds) thanks to the search tools. Use it on any computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) and on any phone (android, IOs). Synchronize your data on the cloud you choose : Nextcloud (see below), Google Drive, One Drive, etc. So you can have all your data written everywhere, all the time, on any media. Secure all your texts by encrypting them with a password. Have a fully customizable interface that allows you to focus totally on what you are writing, so that you dont waste time and attention. Export your notes in many ways, with a format (markdown) that can be read anywhere and at any time. Automatically manage the images and files you insert in your notes. Automatically edit your notes (so you can go back at any time if you made a mistake). And much more. The Markdown syntax Markdown is an easy to read and write syntax for formatting text that is widely used today. By the way, please note that the document in this workshop is written in markdown! The markdown syntax consists of a set of rules that indicate how the text should be formatted into a classic text format that can be read by any text editor. The text will then be formatted by a program to read it, or to make it a document to be published or shared. Here are some examples that will allow you to better understand the Markdown syntax: Here are some examples that will allow you to better understand the Markdown syntax: The word **markdown** is in bold. This makes the following appearance when formatted by a software like Joplin: The word markdown is in bold. To indicate a link is written : A link to the [wikipedia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) of markdown. This gives: A link to the wikipedia page of markdown. To learn more about markdown syntax, you can visit the corresponding wikipedia page, which contains many examples. But dont worry: Joplin offers many tools and examples so you dont have to learn this syntax. The advantages of Markdown are numerous : A Markdown document is a text document that can be opened with any text editor (notepad, Notepad++, Atom, etc.). Editing a document in markdown allows you to focus on the meaning of what you are writing, without worrying about the appearance: this is the What you see is what you mean philosophy. This philosophy is the opposite of the what you see is what you get philosophy found in software such as Microsoft Word, in which you edit both the content of the document and its format at the same time. A Markdown document can be read in different ways by programs that will put it in form (of which there are many), and which can transcribe it into many different formats (.pdf, .html, etc.) and with different appearances (font, colors, etc.) very quickly. Reading all this, if you dont know Markdown yet, youre probably skeptical. But dont worry: Joplin allows you to bypass Markdown if you dont like it. But youll find that trying it is usually the same as adopting it. Installing Joplin Simply go to the softwares web page Choose the version corresponding to your operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux. Launch the installer and follow the instructions.  If you wish to have the interface in your native langage, think of indicating it during the installation. If you have not done so, you can change the language in Tools then Options then General. Getting started with Joplin Interface By default, the Joplin window consists of 3 important parts: the list of your notebooks on the left. the list of notes inside the notebook you are in, in the middle. the editor on the right, which is usually displayed in two parts (the editing part, and the viewing part). The essential What you need to know to understand the basics of how Joplin works: Notebooks can contain notes, or other notebooks. Notes are written in markdown syntax. Notes can be associated with one or more tags, which allow you to find them more easily The editor shows you both the document written in Markdown language (left), and its appearance once formatted by the Joplin theme you have chosen (right). The editor contains various buttons to easily format the Markdown text (bold, italic, link, list, title, etc.). Joplin contains a notebook with a few notes summarizing all the features of the program; do not delete them! They may be very useful to you. With the command Ctrl + P, you can access the search bar which allows you to find a note in a few seconds. Just type words related to the note. Exercises It would be possible for me to list all the features of Joplin; but that would be very long to read (there are many), and rather boring. Through some exercises, I encourage you to discover them by yourself. 1. Create a notebook In Joplin, create a new notebook, named  Notebook for exercise.  Note the possibility of putting emojis in the titles of your notebooks and your notes to better differentiate them. 2. Create a note In the Notebook for Exercise, create a new note named Note for Exercise with the New Note button. 3. Inserting an image in a note Open the note Note for Exercise in the editor. Go to this link. In your browser, right click on the image, and choose Copy. Go back to your note. Right click in the editor and choose Paste, or press Ctrl + V.  Joplin handles all files associated with your Markdown documents automatically, whether its an image, an excel spreadsheet, or something else. It is only able to display images, and other file types will be represented as a link that will allow you to open them. All files are kept in its database, and it is even possible to edit them by clicking on the link. Extremely practical to find your way around! 4. Create a task and a task list In the Exercise Book, create a new task named Exercise 4 Task with the New Task button.  In Joplin, tasks are simply notes that are associated with a checkbox. However, you can, as with any note, associate files, images, and text with them. In the editor, write the following (be careful to respect spaces!): - [ ] Make a new task in Joplin - [ ] Write a task list in the Markdown text of this task - [ ] Check the boxes in this task list - [ ] Check the task Look at the formatted text of your task on the right side of the editor. Click on the various check boxes, and see what happens. When this is done, check your checkmark in the Joplin Notes window. Watch what happens.  You have discovered one of the most useful features of Markdown: checkboxes. In text format, an unchecked box is written - [ ], and a checked box is written - [x]. 5. Using tags Give the note Note for exercise the tag Exercise by finding adding a tag with the corresponding button at the bottom of the interface. Notice that a new tag category has appeared in the notebook menu.  Labels are extremely useful for finding notes easily. Sorting your notes by putting them in different notebooks can be useful; but since you can only put a note in one notebook, it remains limited. Would you put a note with birthday gift ideas for a friend in your friends notebook, or in your ideas notebook? With labels, the question no longer arises: you can put both. I recommend using tags whenever possible! 6. Changing the interface Go to the Display tab, then click on the Change application layout option. Use the arrows on each part of the interface to : Move the editor to the far left of the interface. Put the list of notebooks below the list of notes in the open notebook. Click on the boundaries between sections of the interface to make them a reasonable size. Press Escape to exit the tool to change the composition of the application. Leave the interface as it is, put it back the way it was, or put it the way you prefer! 7. Downloading a plugin Go to the Tools tab, then click on Options. Go to the Plugins tab of the options menu. In the search bar, look for the Quick Links plugin and install it. In the search bar, look for the Note Tabs plugin and install it. Restart Joplin using the little menu that tells you to restart it so that the plugins work; or, shut down Joplin completely (closing the window does not shut down Joplin by default), and restart it. Follow the steps in exercise 6 to adapt your interface to the tabs added by the Note Tabs plugin. If you want to remove the tabs added by the Note Tabs plugin, go to the Plugins menu again, and use the dedicated button to disable the Note Tabs plugin. 8. Inserting links to other notes In the Notebook for Exercise, create a second note named Note to link to. Go back to the Note to exercise note. In it, write the following text in the editor: Here, I will put a link to another note: Complete this text with a link to the Note to link to. To do this, you have two choices: In the notes window, right-click on the Note to link to note, and choose the copy Markdown link option. Then paste this link into your text. Take advantage of the Quick Links plugin you have installed: type @@ in your text, then choose the Note to link to note in the autocomplete window that opens. Once the link is inserted, look at the part of the editor that shows you your formatting. There is a link there. Click on it, and it will take you to the other note. 9. Exporting a note Right-click on the Note for Exercise note in the notes window. Choose the option Export, then PDF. Save the .pdf to your computer, and open it. Other important features of Joplin to discover Joplin has a lot of features. It would take too long to go through them all in this workshop. I recommend you take a look at three of them in particular when you have time: Synchronization with a cloud. This allows you to find all your notes anywhere, including in your cell phone thanks to the Joplin application which is free, and also open-source. Encryption, which allows you to encrypt your notes so that only you can read them. The modification of the appearance of Joplin and the formatting of your documents from the text in Markdown. For any other information, you can go to Joplins website, to its GitHub page, or to its forum. "],["03-zotero.html", "Zotero", " Zotero Zotero is a bibliography management software. Having complete and rigorous bibliography information is necessary in academic documents (thesis, dissertation, article). It can also be very important for blog or website posts, videos, scripts, and many others. It can additionally be very useful for managing personal resources, as we will see later. The bibliography information of a document is called meta-data, i.e. data about the document, but outside the document (its title, its publication date, its author(s), etc.). Features of Zotero Zotero allows you to : Easily save all the metadata associated with a document (title, authors, place of publication, date, URL, etc.). Associate notes or tags to each reference or document. Sort these references by categorys, or by their characteristics to find them easily. Download associated PDF files when possible. Export bibliography files that contain all the details of the references, so that they can be inserted into a document. Insert and manage the bibliography of a document in Microsoft Word, Libreoffice or Google Doc using its plugins. Installing Zotero Go to the Zotero website and download the installer. Follow the instructions to install it. If Zotero offers you to install the module for Word or Libreoffice, you can do it now; otherwise, it will be offered as an exercise later. Open Zotero. In its window, go to the Tools tab, and click on the Install the Zotero Connector in the browser option. Follow the instructions to install the connector. Prise en main de Zotero The main interface In its main interface, Zotero offers you a menu on the left where you can create different collections that contain references. In the middle, you will find the list of references of the collection you are in. On the right, you will find the details of a reference you have clicked on. At the top, you will find different options to create a reference yourself. However, you will be able to do it automatically thanks to the extension that will connect Zotero to your web browser. The Zotero Connector for your web browser When you go to a web page, read a blog post or a scientific article in your web browser, the Zotero Connector allows you to save the information from the page you are reading in your reference library with one click. To do this, you just need to click on the connector button in your web browser, normally located in the upper right corner. This button can have different icons, depending on the page you are on. **Zotero will automatically detect the document the page is referring to, whether it is a blog post, a book, or a scientific article. Exercises 1. Creating a collection At the top left of the Zotero window, find the create a new collection button. Use it to create a new collection of articles named Exercise. 2. Retrieving 5 different references In the Zotero window, make sure you are in the article collection named Exercise. Go to the following links in your web browser: Link 1, Link 2, Link 3, Link 4, Link 5. For each of the links, use the Zotero connector button in your web browser to have Zotero save the metadata related to the 5 articles directly into your library. Look at the articles in the Zotero window: Zotero could not find all the metadata for two of them. We will go and look for them ourselves using Google Scholar. Go to Google Scholar. In the search bar, type the title of one of the two articles that Zotero failed to detect correctly. In the list of Google Scholar results, find the article. Also in this list, find the quotation mark button under the articles information. In the pop-up that opens, click on the link that says BibTex. Google Scholar will take you to a page with a text sequence. This is the information related to this reference in a format called BibTex. Select the text and press Copy or Ctrl + C. Go back to the Zotero window, go to the File tab, then click Import from Clipboard. You can now see that Zotero has inserted the correct metadata for this article. Delete the incomplete metadata by right-clicking on it, then `Remove document to trash. Repeat the operation for the other article that Zotero did not detect well. 3. Installing the Zotero module for Word or for Libreoffice If you did not do so during the installation, install the Zotero module for Microsoft Word or for Libreoffice, by clicking on Edit, Preferences, Cite tab, Text processing tab, Install word module or Install Libreoffice module. 4. Installing the Zotero Better BibTex plugin Do a right clic on this link and select Save link as to download the Better BibTex plugin  The Better BibTex plugin allows to better connect Zotero with other software that uses Markdown. Well use it next! In the Zotero window, go to the Tools tab, then Extensions. Then click on the little gear icon on the right side of the window, and choose the Install from a file option. In the window that opens, select the Better BibTex plugin file that you downloaded. Restart Zotero. 5. Exporting your Zotero database with the automatic update option In the Zotero window, go to File, and select the Export Library option. In the Format list, choose the Better BibTex format In the options, choose the Keep current option, and leave all others unchecked. Export the resulting .bib file somewhere on your computer.  This .bib file contains the information of all the references in your library, together with a small code for each one that we will be able to insert in Markdown documents. On top of that, it is automatically kept up to date with the Better BibTex plugin; this means that every time you add a reference in Zotero, this .bib file will be updated to add it. 6. Using the Joplin BibTex plugin to add references Open Joplin. Go to the Tools tab, then click on Options. Go to the Plugins tab in the options menu. In the search bar, look for the Bibtex plugin and install it. Restart Joplin. Go back to the Tools tab, then click on Options. Go to the BibTex Plugin tab that appeared in the options. In the BibTex File field, write the path to the .bib file you generated in exercise 5. Choose the Pandoc syntax option (coming soon). Exit the options, and create a new note named Note with references in Joplin. In this note, write the following sentence: Open-source software has a long history . Position your cursor in the Joplin editor just before the period at the end of the sentence. Then, you have two choices: In Joplin, in the toolbar containing the editor buttons, click on the button shaped like a graduation hat. In the list that opens (which contains your references), look for the article by Bretthauer that you added earlier. Press Enter to validate. Write the code for the reference yourself, by writing square brackets [ ] with a @ inside, pasted to the articles unique identifier in Zotero (found at the very top of the article information). Once you have added the reference, watch how it looks in the editor.  You can observe that the BibTex plugin formats the reference inside the text, but also automatically adds a references part at the end of your note that indicates all the documents referenced in your note.  The syntax I recommend you use in your markdown notes for references is the one used by Pandoc, a well known open-source software that allows you to transform a text document into almost any format. This elegant syntax allows you to put the citation in the text in the format you want. To learn more about this syntax, go to this link. "],["05-nextcloud.html", "Nextcloud", " Nextcloud Nextcloud is a cloud software like Google Drive, allowing to host files, but also containing multiple very useful applications. However, unlike Google Drive, it is open-source and free. Features of Nextcloud Nextcloud allows you to: Have an online file storage space that is totally yours. Have access to lots of different applications all open-source that allow you to manage to-do lists, kanban boards, calendars, contacts, notes, recipes, maps, track your phones location, collaborate on documents, and much more.  It is totally possible to synchronize your Joplin database on a Nextcloud installation. This is recommended by the creators of Joplin, because Joplin has a Nextcloud integration application with Nextcloud ! Installation of Nextcloud Here, its a bit special. Nextcloud cannot be installed on your computer. It must be installed on a computer server, which is a particular computer made to answer requests from clients (like your computer) via the internet. This server can be owned by a company (many companies rent servers to host their website, storage space like Nextcloud or other things); or, you can buy a small one for yourself, like a Raspberry Pi. It is still possible to make your computer a server; but this is not practical. The server application would have to be running on your computer at all times for your Nextcloud instance to be accessible. So, we wont see the installation of Nextcloud here, which can be complicated. You will however have a list of options to get a Nextcloud server for free, or at a low cost. Keep in mind though that these different options represent different levels of security for your data. If you want to make sure that the data on your Nextcloud server is only accessible to you, you will need to purchase your own server (see below). By choosing a third party hosting company, it is possible that your data can be analyzed for advertising purposes (although this is much less likely than with Google Drive). By doing so, you also accept the fact that this company has your data on their servers, and that these hosting companies will be able to read your data, or submit it to the law and provide it to the authorities if required by them. At this level, some countries (such as Switzerland) have a stricter jurisdiction in terms of privacy protection. However, if you wish to rely on a hosting company but keep your data totally private, you will need to encrypt the existing data on your Nextcloud. This is possible, but we wont talk about it today. So here are different options to get a Nextcloud instance: By a third party host with Nextcloud pre-installed: Hertznet : German host, very competitive prices, very good performance. My personal choice. Wolkli : Swiss host. Much more expensive, but difficult to do better in terms of data protection (Swiss laws normally protect any access against your will). Cloudamo : European hosting company. Offers a free version that we will use today, but also paid options. Sometimes a bit slow. Buying your own server: Buy a Raspberry Pi and install Nextcloud on it. Buy a prepared server from those recommended by Nextcloud. For this workshop, we will use an account on a hosting company that offers a free Nextcloud account with access to many applications, Cloudamo. Go to the Nextcloud main page. In the bar in the center, enter your email address. In the list of hosts below, choose Cloudamo. Click on Sign up. In the page that opens, choose a password and click on Log in. Go to your mailbox to find the confirmation email from Cloudamo. Look in your spam folder. Click on the validation link in the e-mail from Cloudamo and log in on the page that opens.  If you decide to use Nextcloud and you liked Cloudamo, you can choose a subscription with this host to get more storage space! But I highly recommend Hertznet. Getting started with Nextcloud In Nextcloud, you can switch from one application to another thanks to the icons at the top of the screen. At the top right is an icon that allows you to change different settings related to your profile, or to log out. Exercises 1. Creating tasks with different priorities, in different categories On Nextcloud, go to the Tasks tab. In the menu on the left, click on Add a list to create a to-do list named Personal. Do the same thing to create another list named Social.  To-do lists, just like the calendars we will see next, are associated with colors. Use them to easily differentiate between different lists, and thus categorize your tasks! In the Nextcloud task list, create 5 new tasks: Create tasks for exercise 1 Understand how Nextcloud works Watch a cute cat video Watch a cute dog video Do the dishes For the Understanding how Nextcloud works task, use the small button to the right of the task to add three subtasks: Understand how Nextcloud tasks work Understand how Nextcloud kanban boards work Understand how Nextcloud calendars work In the Social task list, create 2 new tasks: Call my best friend to tell her I like her a lot Prepare a party Click on each of these tasks in turn. In the menu that opens on the right, set a priority for these tasks. At the top right of the screen, find the button to choose how the tasks are sorted. Sort them by priority, and see how they are organized. 2. Putting comments in the tasks On Nextcloud, go to the Tasks tab. Click on each of the tasks created during exercise 1 in turn. In the menu that opens on the right, write some details about the task. For example: the dog video you want to watch must be about a Samoyed. You can even put a link to a video you want to watch later. 3. Create and use a Kanban board On Nextcloud, go to the Deck tab. In the menu on the left, use Add a board to create a new kanban board named Organization and open-source workshop. Go to this new board, and create 3 columns in it: To Do, In Progress, and Completed. In the To Do column, use the little + button to create 4 new cards: Discover Joplin Discover Zotero Discover Nextcloud Discover methods to implement them Move the cards to the right columns: the first three should go in the Done column. The 4th one must go in the to do column. The last one must stay where it is. Click on the Discover Nextcloud card. In the description of the card, write the following text: - [ ] Understand what is Nextcloud - [ ] Understand what Nextcloud is for - [ ] Do the exercise 1 - [ ] Do exercise 2 - [ ] Do exercise 3 - [ ] Do exercise 4 - [ ] Do exercise 5 - [ ] Do exercise 6 Close the card window, and look at what is now written on it in the board. Reopen the card window by clicking on it. Check the boxes in the descriptions with the click of your mouse. Go back to the board, and look at what is happening. At the top right, find the button that opens the board menu. Go to the Tags tab. Create two new tags, choosing the colors you want: Software and Methods. Open the description of the cards to put the corresponding tag on them. Look at the visual result of your chart.  Kanban boards are excellent for visually seeing the status of a project, whether for yourself or with others. It may seem intimidating, but dont hesitate to try it! Many videos and articles exist on the internet to learn about them, if you are curious. 4. Using the calendar On Nextcloud, go to the Agenda tab. Next to the Today button in the left menu, use the button that allows you to change the view (day, week, month, etc.). Try the different views, then select the month view.  The groups of tasks and events of the calendar are within the same file in Nextcloud! This is because both are in the format named ICalendar. The ICalendar format is a data format used by almost all existing mailboxes. It is the same one that is used, generally, when you receive an invitation to an event by mail! It is also a format that makes synchronization with your phone very easy, as we will see soon. If one of your tasks is associated with a date, it will appear in your calendar! Double-click in the box corresponding to today to bring up the window allowing you to create a new event. Name this event End of Nextcloud exercises. Schedule it for today, and to start in 10 minutes. Its duration does not matter. Put it in the Personal calendar. Create a new event on todays date, named Workshop to discover open-source software to get organized. Check the box to indicate that this will be an all-day event. Put it in the Personal calendar again. Create a new event in two days, named Meet with myself, from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and put it in the Social agenda.  As you can see, the spots that are displayed in your calendar are associated with the color of the calendar in which they are located! This is very useful to be able to visually differentiate very quickly which event concerns which area of your life. As for the list of tasks, take advantage of it ! 5. Synchronizing Nextcloud tasks with your phone Take your cell phone in hand. If you are on an android phone: Go to the Google Play Store to download the free, open source Tasks.org app (or use F-droid for that). Open the app, and tap the menu icon in the top left corner. Go to the Settings section. Tap the Add Account option, then choose a CalDAV account. In the User name field, enter the email address you used to sign up for Cloudamo. In the Password field, enter the password you use to log into Cloudamo. In the URL field, enter https://us.cloudamo.com. Validate, then let the application do its synchronization. In the application menu, check that you now have access to the task lists you created on Cloudamo. Click on the tasks to see that you can edit them in all their details: their priority, their notes, their subtasks, etc.  Tasks.org is a totally open-source and free application to manage your tasks. It has a lot of features. Change its theme, set icons for your to-do lists, use its widgets to quickly add to-dos from your home screen, make recurring to-dos, and much more! If you are on an Apple phone: Open the Reminders application. Select the Calendar option. Select the Accounts option, then Add Account. Select the Other option as the account type, then Add CalDAV account. In the URL field, enter https://us.cloudamo.com. In the User Name field, enter the email address you used to sign up for Cloudamo. In the Password field, enter the password you use to log into Cloudamo. Let the application do its synchronization. Go to the Reminders application and check that you now have access to the task lists you created on Cloudamo.  It seems that IOS will not allow communication with your Nextcloud account if it is not on a server that offers so-called encrypted communication using a valid SSL certificate. If you have problems, you can download another application from the appstore that can handle it, like 2Do.  Apple phones do not have many open-source and private applications available. It is impossible for me to say who will be able to access your data using these applications. On the other hand, Tasks.org on Android does not have this problem. At your own risk!  Know that there is a free open-source application to synchronize and view your Nextcloud Deck Kanban boards on your phone! Go to your app store, and search for Nextcloud Deck. 6. Synchronizing the Nextcloud calendar with your phone Take your cell phone in hand. If you are on an android phone: Go to the Google Play Store to download the free, open source DAVx5 app (or use F-droid for that). Open the application, and get to the screen that allows you to add an account. Choose the option Connect with a URL and a username. In the URL field, enter https://us.cloudamo.com. In the User Name field, enter the email address you used to sign up for Cloudamo. In the Password field, enter the password you use to log into Cloudamo. Let the application do its synchronization. Go to your phones calendar. If you dont have one yet, you can download the open-source application Simple calendar.  Despite its strange name, DAVx5 is a fantastic application. It is secure and recommended by Nextcloud developers to sync your phone with your Nextcloud installation. If you choose another Nextcloud host, you can simply enter the URL of the Nextcloud server you are connecting to instead of Cloudamos.  On Android, if you are using the Google calendar, it is impossible for me to know if your calendar data will be read or shared by Google. I recommend you to use an open-source application like Simple calendar instead. If you are on an Apple phone: Open the Reminders application. Select the Calendar option. Select the Accounts option, then Add Account. Select the Other option as the account type, then Add CalDAV account. In the URL field, enter https://us.cloudamo.com. In the User Name field, enter the email address you used to sign up for Cloudamo. In the Password field, enter the password you use to log into Cloudamo. Let the application do its synchronization. Go to your phones calendar.  Apple phones do not have many open-source and private applications available. It is impossible for me to say who will be able to access your data using these applications. Whatever your phone is: Check in your calendar settings that the Personal and Social calendars are synchronized. Check that the events you have created previously are displayed. 7. Synchronizing your files with your computer or phone On your computer: Go to this page to download the Nextcloud software that will allow the synchronization of your files between your computer and Nextcloud  Indeed, Nextcloud is also used to store files, just like Google Drive, One Drive, or Drop Box! Once you have downloaded the executable, install it. Run the program. Tell the program the URL of your Nextcloud server (https://us.cloudamo.com), your Cloudamo username, and your password. Let the synchronization take place.  *From now on, if you drop a new file in your Nextcloud folder on your computer, it will be uploaded to Cloudamos servers. Conversely, if a file has been added to your Nextcloud on Cloudamos servers, it will be downloaded to your computer. Thus, there is a constant synchronization, via this small software, between your Nextcloud installation and your computer in terms of files. You can, of course, customize this synchronization in the application settings. On your phone: Install the Nextcloud app from your app store Launch the Nextcloud app, and tell it the Cloudamo URL, along with your username and password.

Each of these methods are much discussed on the internet, especially the Zettelkasten method which is the oldest. If you are curious, you can find out more by typing their name in a search engine. Finally, we will see how these methods can be combined together to manage different types of information in your life. "],["07-zettelkasten.html", "The Zettelkasten method", " The Zettelkasten method The Zettelkasten is a method of knowledge management and note taking. The word Zettelkasten comes from German, and could be translated as note box or idea box, or sliding box. It is a method used in scientific research or studies; however, it can also be useful for organizing your general knowledge. This method was developed by Conrad Gessner in the 16th century, and has been used by various researchers since. In particular, Nijlas Luhmann (German sociologist) had a Zettelkasten of 90,000 cards, to which he attributed much of his great writing productivity (more than 70 books and 400 scientific articles during his lifetime). Purpose of the Zettelkasten The Zettelkasten is used to take note of knowledge with the help of a software, or papers. This method has several very important features: It makes it easier to classify knowledge in order to find it very quickly. The Zettelkasten achieves this by associating each note with labels, but also with other notes. Thus, many different paths can lead to your note; and since each note represents a specific piece of knowledge, you can find it easily! It classifies information in a very simple and instinctive way. If you are interested in religion and philosophy, and you want to make a note about the famous Pascals wager; would you put this note in the religion category, or in the philosophy category? In a Zettelkasten, this question does not arise, because there are no categories. This makes sorting or finding your note much more instinctive. It allows us to easily see the connections that can exist between different knowledge. This allows for a strong creativity, by perceiving links between information that we would otherwise have seen as separate. It is used to encapsulate information. To understand encapsulation, imagine the following situation: you decide to create a web site about elephants. On your site, you have a page that talks about what elephants do all day, and another that talks about the effect of elephant dung on their environment. Youll soon realize that these two pages are going to have to talk, at some point, about what the elephants eat. So you have a choice: you can write about what the elephants eat on these two pages, which requires you to rewrite the information twice. Also, if that information changes (for example, a new discovery is made about the diet of elephants) you will have to change both pages. However, you can also make a page that talks about what elephants eat, and simply put a link to that page in your other two pages. In this way, you dont have to rewrite the information over and over again, and you only have to change it once if you need to. You have thus encapsulated the information about what elephants eat by separating it from the rest, and linking to it where necessary. The Zettelkasten method encourages encapsulation as much as it is possible, making you write things once, and making it easy to edit and connect your knowledge. It avoids having to search for information in long notes or texts. This is a consequence of encapsulating information. To use the previous example, you dont have to skim one of the two long pages on the daily life of elephants, or the one on the effects of their dung to find out what they eat. Youll just have to find the right page, or the right note, to find the right information. It makes taking notes more enjoyable. This is certainly the most subjective aspect, but it seems undeniable to me. Taking notes on complicated subjects is often a time-consuming activity, and it can be very discouraging to end up with a bunch of long and complex notes that dont serve our purposes well, and seem useless in the end. The Zettelkasten makes the activity of taking notes on anything and everything - how to identify a kind of tree, statistics related to a problem in the world that affects us, thoughts that cross our mind - organized, rigorous, and above all productive. Each of the notes created within a Zettelkasten invites reflection and creation. Each of the notes can be quickly retrieved for use when needed. Thus, this activity becomes less laborious, less full of doubts, and much more satisfying. Each note becomes a seed planted in the ground that will bear fruit in the future. Image from Gapingvoid. Setting up a Zettelkasten Nowadays, it is very easy to set up a Zettelkasten using a software like Joplin. However, this method requires a little bit of practice. Indeed, a Zettelkasten must respect three main principles, which we will state here. The principles of the Zettelkasten The Zettelkasten must be composed of notes that respect the principle of atomicity. Behind this complicated name lies a simple reality: your notes should be as short as possible, and should consider a very specific topic in particular. This is atomicity: just as an atom is defined as an object that is not separable into parts, your notes should, as much as possible, not be separable into other notes. This allows you to encapsulate the information as much as possible, and avoid very long notes that can be a nightmare to find. Smaller notes will also make it easier to make links between notes (see below). In practice, it is quite normal to start writing short notes; then, as they get longer if you add things to them, to split them into several notes. In the Zettelkasten, the notes are called Zettel, which means in Germannote! Thus, each Zettel must respect the principle of atomicity. The Zettelkasten should not be textual, but hyper-textual. Again, behind these complicated words lies a simple reality. Imagine for a moment if the online encyclopedia Wikipedia was not composed of a huge number of different articles (as it is now), but of a single web page containing all the information of Wikipedia? If this were the case, the Wikipedia encyclopedia would be in a classic textual form: a long linear text with a beginning and an end, like a book. To find the right information, we would have to look at what is between this beginning and this end, and our reading would always be guided in that direction. This is what we do when we read a dictionary. Fortunately, Wikipedia is not a textual encyclopedia, but a hyper-textual one. This means that it is composed of documents (articles) linked together by hyperlinks. You know these hyperlinks well: they are simply the links you find on web pages, and on which you are used to click. Hyper-textual organization avoids structuring information in a linear way (from a beginning to an end), and makes its writing - and access - quite organic. In Wikipedia, articles are created and linked to each other as they are needed. The order in which these articles are written does not matter; nor does the order in which they are read. What matters is the presence of connections and links between them. The same applies to a Zettelkasten, which is often compared to a personal Wikipedia. In a Zettelkasten, the priority is not so much the collection of information, but the connection of information to each other. For this, the Zettels (notes) contained in a Zettelkasten will all have a unique identifier, like a web page. This identifier will allow to create connections between the Zettels, just like links between wikipedia pages. There is one Zettelkasten for one person, and one person per Zettelkasten. A Zettelkasten must be personal, and several people should not work together on one Zettelkasten. The reason for this is that we are all very different in the way we choose, record, and connect the information we come in contact with. So what will make sense to one person may not make sense to another. A Zettelkasten must be extremely comfortable for you. And although you wont always remember everything you wrote down, and how you made the connections, they will make sense to you when you find them, at the time when you need them. It is also important for your memory and your learning that you are the one who takes the time to make the notes, in order to get into the habit of doing so, and in order to better retain the information in them. On top of all that, a Zettelkasten can contain very personal things. Im not necessarily talking about passwords, or your bank details: although these can go into a Zettelkasten, this is not recommended. However, your Zettelkasten may contain notes about your emotions; your thoughts; or your experiences. It is important then that you feel comfortable with the idea of putting these words into notes, knowing that they will not be read by anyone but you if you do not wish to. Your Zettelkasten will be yours; a real home for your thoughts and ideas. Anatomy of the Zettelkasten Now that we have seen the main principles of the Zettelkasten, it is time to see how to set it up, practically. Lets start with the components of a Zettelkasten: the Zettels, the labels, the links, and the boxes. The Zettels A Zettel is a note, and it is the basic component of the Zettelkasten. Image from zettelkasten.de. A Zettel is composed of three parts: A unique identifier A body/content A footer that contains references And thats it! When making a Zettelkasten in paper format, it is important to have a well-defined methodology for choosing the unique identifier of each Zettel. But when you make a Zettelkasten with a program like Joplin (what I will propose here), you dont need to worry about it! Indeed, when Joplin creates a new note, it is automatically associated with a unique random identifier which will not change (even if you change the title of the note afterwards). You can see this by clicking on the icon that allows you to see the notes properties in Joplin, at the top right of the interface. The body or content of the note should be clear and concise. If it becomes too long, then it would be very interesting to see if the note can be split into several notes, which will all remain as short as possible. It is important, as much as possible, that you yourself write the body of the note. This pushes you to write your own version of the information, which leads to a better understanding of it, but also to better recall it. So, as much as possible, avoid simply cutting and pasting information into a note. The footer of the note, containing the references, can be generated automatically by the software if it manages bibliographic references (this is the case of Joplin with the BibTex plugin). If the note contains some of your thoughts, you can leave this part empty. The tags Lets remember what was said earlier: a Zettelkasten has no categories. This means that Zettelkasten will not be categorized in any way. Instead, the Zettelkasten uses tags. The difference between tags and categories is important to understand. A category could be thought of as a box; a tag, as a small colored sticker that could be stuck on a note. Thus, a note can have only one category (it can only be put in one box), but it can have several tags (several stickers). Thus, in the Zettelkasten, notes will never be categorized. When a note is created, you only have to think about the tags you want to associate it with. For example, a note about what elephants eat might have the tags elephants, food, and biology. The process is much more organic, and much simpler: there is no real hesitation about where to put your note. You just have to put the tags that you think correspond to it. Thats good, because Joplin handles tags very well! Tags are important so that you can easily make connections between your notes in a very creative way. For example, if you look at all your notes with the tag food, you might find interesting relationships between what notes that youve made about the diet of different species. The links The links between Zettels are very important in a Zettelkasten. They allow you to find information easily, to structure it, but also to see things you would not have seen otherwise. A link in a Zettle works exactly like a link in wikipedia, which will bring you to another article. To make this link, you just need to use the unique ID of the Zettle you want to link to. In Joplin, it is possible to easily make a link in Markdown that you can click to go to another note, as if you were browsing a website! To do this, just right click on the note you want to link to in the list of Joplin notes, and choose Copy Markdown Link. You can then paste the link wherever you want. Joplin also has a plugin that allows you to make retroactive links. This means that if you read a note that is linked to in another note, the plugin will show you a backlink to that note in the formatted note. This means that you can navigate back and forth between two notes very easily and effortlessly, but it also allows you to see the connections between your notes even better. The boxes As we said, a Zettelkasten does not have categories. However, it can be very useful to define one or two that are not related to the content of the notes, but to their type. For example, you can have a category named notes to write. In this category, you will leave notes that you did not have time to complete properly, and for which you quickly scribbled something to finish later. You can also have an indexing notes category, which contains notes that serve as summaries for different topics, and that allows you to quickly access the information. For example, you could make a note called Elephant Information, which will contain many links to notes that talk about elephants. Hence, you could use these indexing notes to go looking for information when you need to find it. There is really no limit to what can be done. The only important thing is that these categories should not touch the content of the notes, to avoid any ambiguity about which category/box the note should be placed in. Using a Zettelkasten in everyday life Now you know the structure of a Zettelkasten inside out. Now lets see how it is maintained on a daily basis. Adding notes When you come across an interesting piece of information, simply add a Zettle in your Zettelkasten. Of course, not every piece of information you come across in your daily life should be put in a note. How do you know, in this case, what should be written, or what should be left? A rule of thumb is to ask yourself is it just information, or is it knowledge? Which is like asking Will this be useful to me in the future? Thus, it may not be worth making a note about the fact that at 2:30 pm yesterday, you ate a delicious pasta dish (information). On the other hand, writing down the recipe of the pasta dish might be interesting (knowledge). Similarly, anything that might be useful for your work or studies can be put in a note form. Now that you have decided to write the note, how big should it be? Remember the principle of atomicity: your note should be short, and contain essential information related to a very specific topic. If it starts to get too long, consider splitting it into several notes. If you can, try to follow a structure that you like. Once you have written the note, remember to include references. Then, take the time to choose labels carefully, as this is an important step. And thats it, youre done! Maintaining your Zettelkasten. Every once in a while, take the time to explore your Zettelkasten. Look at the notes related to a particular label to discover interesting links; or, do a keyword search to find similar notes, and make a summary note that organizes it with a structure so you can easily find your way around. Use the knowledge youve gathered to write articles, books, summaries, or more! 3 Trust yourself! As you can see, all the principles and rules of the Zettelkasten remain flexible, and are based on your perception of things and your preferences. This can be very intimidating when you are a beginner, and can lead to a lot of doubts. Is this note too long? Should I make a note of this? Should I associate it to this tag ? All these questions are natural, and can push you to improve. However, they can quickly tire you out and demotivate you. Remember that the most important action of a Zettelkasten is to write and explore! Trust yourself, and go for it. No matter what happens, a Zettelkasten is still a very dynamic thing, and you can edit it without any problems in the future. Exercises During these exercises, we will set up a Zettelkasten in the Joplin software. However, there are other programs that allow you to set up a Zettelkasten, such as Zettlr! Feel free to choose what suits you best. From my own experience, Joplin has proven to be the easiest to use and the most complete. 1. Preparing Joplin to make a Zettelkasten Open Joplin, and go to the Tools tab, then Options. Go to Plugins, then download the Automatic Backlinks to note plugin. The more curious can also download the Link Graph UI plugin, which allows you to visualize the connections between notes in the form of an interactive graph. Go back to the Joplin interface. Create a new notebook named Zettelkasten. Within this notebook, create three other notebooks: Notes to write, Atomic notes, and Indexing notes.  Thats it, you are ready to start your Zettelkasten in Joplin! All the other functions needed to create a Zettelkasten are already present in Joplin. In particular, making links and associating tags to a note are very easy to do. Plus, since you can have Joplin on your phone, youll be able to make notes anywhere, anytime! 2. Write 6 different Zettels. In the Atomic Notes notebook you created earlier, write 6 different Zettels. Try to put references in them, find labels for them, and make links between them. To make a label in Joplin, click on the Click to add labels button at the bottom of the screen. In the window that opens, you can find a drop-down list of tags that already exist; or, you can create new ones. To get a Markdown link to a given note, right-click on that note in the note list, and choose the option Get Markdown Link. To help you, here is a list of titles/themes for these Zettels, with a small link to a web page that will offer you interesting information to fill it in: Elephants may hear the sound of clouds Infrasound Elephants can get drunk on fermented fruit Elephants recognize themselves in a mirror The Gallup Mirror Test Alcoholic fermentation 3. Write an indexing Zettel. In the Indexing Notes notebook, create a new note called Amazing Things About Elephants. Fill in this indexing Zettel by linking to some of the notes you have written recently. Its up to you to decide what order you want to put them in. "],["08-PARA.html", "The P.A.R.A method", " The P.A.R.A method Image from Forte Labs. The P.A.R.A. (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method is a method for organizing digital information. It was developed by Forte Labs, a company that creates content to help increase productivity through technology. Usefulness of the P.A.R.A. method The P.A.R.A. method allows you to organize your digital information into different categories, so that it is easy for you to get organized with it. It allows you to know where to find information in your overall organization, and why. These words may sound vague to you, but they make sense when you consider everything youve seen in this workshop so far. Youve discovered tools for taking notes, writing tasks, organizing projects; but now, lets imagine that youre faced with the fact that youd like to try a new recipe that youve been very interested in. Where do you put this recipe? In your notes? Your tasks? Your projects? Where will you keep it, once you have finished it? The P.A.R.A. method allows you to answer these questions with as little effort as possible. You probably realize that this is very important to you, because having many different tools, adapted to different needs, can be confusing. Implementing the P.A.R.A. method The P.A.R.A method is used like a map that will guide you in the use of your different organizational tools. Globally, we can imagine it as a way to sort information according to two characteristics: their usefulness (what is it for?), and their format (what is its format? On which software?). Sorting information according to its usefulness To understand how the P.A.R.A. method sorts information according to its usefulness, you only need to understand the 4 elements that make up its name: Project, Area of Responsibility, Resource and Archive. Image from Forte Labs. A project is defined as a series of tasks related to a goal, with a deadline. Examples of projects might be planning this years vacation; writing a blog post; or buying a new computer. They all have a specific goal, and a deadline implied in them. In short, the easiest way to know if something is a project is to know if it is supposed to be finished in a given time, after having accomplished different tasks. Any information about a project will therefore go into project-related files. Understanding what is a project and what is not is very important in the P.A.R.A. method. One of the reasons for this is that identifying projects allows you to identify what you are completing and what you are finishing, which is very motivating. Conversely, if you confuse project and area of responsibility (see below), you run the risk of not achieving that progress, which is important for your short-term morale; but also for measuring your long-term productivity. What did you achieve last year? An area of responsibility is defined as an area of activity with a standard to be maintained over time. Areas of responsibility can be my health; my friends; badminton; my apartment. These are parts of your life, with fairly well-defined boundaries, that do not represent projects, but which will require you to perform tasks on a daily basis. These tasks are not linked to a specific goal that will end at a certain time. Thus, taking care of your friends is not a project, but a part of your life with certain responsibilities. Similarly, your project to write a blog post might require you to do some work today; but so does going shopping for a niece piece of clothing for your best friends birthday tomorrow. Distinguishing between project and area of responsibility allows you to use different - but appropriate - tools for both. One last thing to remember is that your projects will almost always fall within an area of responsibility, which is perfectly normal! You can visualize things as in the following diagram, where the little squares represent spots, and the circle represents an area of responsibility. Image from Forte Labs. A resource is defined as a topic or theme of interest to you. So a resource could be knowledge about space, music, gardening, marketing, psychology, or evenorganization. In short, resources would be anything you could put in a Zettelkasten! However, you have to distinguish between a resource (like a very interesting article in psychology) and an information (like the address of the store where you will go to shop for your best friends birthday). This distinction is important, because information does not need to be saved in as readable a way as a resource, which saves time. An archive is simply inactive objects from the other three categories*. Archives would contain information about projects that have been completed (you finished your blog post); areas of responsibility that are no longer part of your life (you quit badminton); or resources that no longer interest you (you no longer watch the Mew Mew Kissy Cutie cartoon you used to love). Now that you understand how the P.A.R.A method sorts information by utility, lets see how it sorts it by format. Sort information by format Digital information can be in many different formats: a simple text file, an image, a link to a web page, a Microsoft Word file, music, a check mark, and many others. The P.A.R.A. method requires that you make these distinctions clear in a simple and understandable way, so that you dont hesitate for a moment about where to put your information. The P.A.R.A method does not give a list of particular software to use: it is up to you to make your definition. However, 3 rules should be respected as much as possible: Limit the number of programs that you use primarily to manage or back up your digital information to 4. The reason behind this number is that it seems to be an important limit in the short-term memory of our brain. Thus, exceeding it makes things much more complex to manage mentally, and often does not give much gain. Doing more with less is always a great doctrine! The structure of the information utilities must be identical in each program. This means that in each program, you will find categories such as Projects, Areas, Resources and Archives; and that within these categories, the organization of the information utilities must be the same in each program you use. This is important in order to have a unique structure that you will find in all your programs, which reduces your mental load, makes switching from one program to another quicker, and avoids you having to search for a long time to find information. On the following pictures, you will find an example of this with 4 different programs. Be careful though: not all programs have to contain all possible types of information! For example, your task manager does not necessarily have to contain folders related to your resources or archives. Images from Forte Labs. The software you use should allow you to hide information that is not useful to you as much as possible when you are working on something. For example, when you are working on a project, you dont need to have folders and files from your different areas of responsibility, or your resources on your screen. You only need the information related to the project. Therefore, the software you use should, as much as possible, be able to hide all irrelevant information from you so that you dont have to constantly sort through all the information on your screen. Finishing setting up P.A.R.A. at the technical level Once you have decided on the software you will use to store your digital information, all that remains is to create the structure of your files in each of your software. And thats it, everything is ready! From now on, all you have to do is put your information in the right place, and in the right software. Do you need to make an appointment with the doctor? This will surely go in a responsibility area named health, and in a task list or calendar software. Do you want to write down the interesting figure you saw about the number of elephants living in Africa? This will surely go into your resource, into a note program like Joplin; maybe even into your Zettelkasten, which integrates very well with the P.A.R.A. method as a resource section! Have you finished your summer camping project? Then move the folder Camping from your Projects area to your Archives area. In the same way, you will only have to look at the right section in the right software to find the right information. The address of the store where you will go shopping for your best friend is probably in a Friends.es area, and is probably in the commentary of a task that you have put in your task manager on this subject. The Word document that contains important data for your work is probably in your file manager, in the corresponding project folder. As for the information you have kept related to the badminton lessons you are taking, they are surely in your archives. As you can see, filing and retrieving information becomes easier. This is very useful when you start to have a lot of information, or to save time no matter what! Apart from adding and retrieving information, you will only have to maintain your organization from time to time. Hence, when a new area of responsibility is added to your life, all you have to do is add a corresponding folder in each of the programs you use. Exercises During these exercises, we will do as if we had decided to use the P.A.R.A method with the help of Joplin, and different applications in Nextcloud. Thus, we will put tasks related to projects in Nextcloud Deck (kanban boards); we will put tasks related to areas of responsibility in Nextcloud Tasks; we will put our resources and notes in Joplin; and finally, we will put our files in Nextcloud Files (Nextclouds file manager, synchronized with your computer). 1. Preparing Nextcloud and Joplin to use the P.A.R.A method  In this exercise, I would suggest filling in Nextcloud and Joplin with example headings. However, feel free to fill them with projects or areas of responsibility that fit your life, so you can start using the P.A.R.A method right away! Go to Nextcloud Tasks Create several task lists: Family, Friends, Work, Karate, Finances and Health.  In the P.A.R.A. method, you decide how many different areas of responsibility you will define. You can be more or less specific: make a Social area, or a Family area, a Friends area, etc. The creator of the P.A.R.A. method recommends doing a lot rather than too little, so that you can better sort your information, but also to see more quickly if some aspects of your life are a little ignored.  Dont forget that you can use emojis in the titles of your responsibility areas! This makes them easier to differentiate at first glance. For example:  Car,  Finance. Go to Nextcloud Deck Create two new tables, in addition to the one created in Nextcloud exercises: Buying a new computer and Bastiens birthday party. Go to Joplin Create 4 new notebooks : 1 - Projects, 2 - Areas, 3 - Resources, 4 - Archives  The numbers in the titles of your notebooks are to make sure that Joplin keeps them organized in the right order. In the 1 - Project notebook, create three new notebooks: Open Source and organization workshop, Buying a New Computer and Bastiens Birthday Party. In the 2 - Areas notebook, create 6 new notebooks: Family, Friends, Work, Karate, Finances and Health. In the notebook 3 - Resources, move the notebook Zettelkasten created in the exercises of to the Zettelkasten. Go to the Nextcloud folder on your computer (which is normally synchronized with your Nextcloud account on Cloudamo, from the exercises on Nextcloud) Create 4 new folders: 1 - Projects, 2 - Areas, 3 - Resources, 4 - Archives In the 1 - Project folder, create three new folders: Open-source and organization workshop, Buying a new computer and Bastiens birthday party. In the folder 2 - Areas, create 6 new folders: Family, Friends, Work, Karate, Finances and Health.  And now you are ready to use the P.A.R.A. method! If you have used projects and areas that fit your life, dont forget to transfer the files and information you already have into the corresponding software. 2. Working on a project with the P.A.R.A method Open Nextcloud Deck, Joplin and the Nextcloud folder on your computer. In Nextcloud Deck, choose the painting Bastiens birthday party. Close the left menu with the small button at the top left of the interface. In Joplin, go to the Bastiens birthday party notebook. Press F10 to hide the notebook menu (press F10 to make it reappear if needed). In your Nextcloud folder, go to the Bastiens birthday party folder. Now try to invent a birthday party for your fictional (or real) friend Bastien. In Nextcloud Deck, create the Find the place, Find the time, Determine who is invited, and Determine the activities cards in the To Do column Move the cards into Nextcloud Deck as you complete the tasks. Feel free to make cards in Joplin, insert details in the description of your cards in Nextcloud Deck, or create or save files in your Nextcloud folder to do so.  Did you notice during the exercise that limiting the visibility of information that was not relevant to your project helped you focus? Everywhere you looked, you only had resources related to your project; in this way, we limited the work your brain had to do to identify what was important in what it was seeing. This kind of thing is not to be underestimated when you work on a computer for a long time. 3. Put your resources in the right place with the P.A.R.A method Open Nextcloud Deck, Joplin and the Nextcloud folder on your computer, and try to put the following information in the right place: Your friend Julia would like to come to Bastiens birthday party. You should review your kata to pass your Karate belt next week. This quote from Lord of the Rings about justice and morality: Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. This image of an old world map you think is very pretty. Youve decided that youd like to buy a laptop instead of a tower, because your current laptop doesnt work very well anymore, and you move around a lot.  Some of these resources are easier to place than others: information about Bastiens birthday and the purchase of a new computer could easily go into Nextcloud Deck. The Lord of the Rings quote could go in your Zettelkasten, and your kata review should go in Nextcloud Tasks with a deadline for the task. The old world map image, however, could be inserted into a Joplin note, or dropped directly into your Nextcloud folder. "],["09-inbox.html", "The inbox method for your tasks", " The inbox method for your tasks An inbox is a virtual box in which items (such as emails or tasks) are accumulated and have a certain priority associated with them. It is simply a virtual box in which items (such as e-mails or tasks) are accumulated and have a certain priority associated with them. So, in an e-mail inbox, the most prioritized and visible mails will be the most recent and unread ones; although mailboxes often allow you to sort messages by other criteria, such as the important mark. Uses of the inbox Concretely, using an inbox for your tasks allows you to quickly visualize which are the most urgent tasks, among those you have to do. Said like that, it doesnt seem to be something extraordinary, you might say. However, it can be very useful to help you work with a clearer mind, and to focus more on what you have to do. Imagine the following situation: You are working, during the day, on a weekday. You receive a call from a friend who suggests you go to an escape game sometime. You both agree that it will be up to you to choose the escape game in question. You then receive an email from your veterinarian, following a health check-up for your cat; your cat is fine, but youll have to buy him a medication he needs quickly. You suddenly think that you should go shopping today. You should also do some laundry because you havent done it in a while. Your supervisor at work comes in, and offers you to take care of a task for which you will have to swap with a colleague, who may not be here today. While taking a break, you spill some tea on your pants, and you notice that they have a hole in them; youll have to get them fixed sometime. You also remember that a long time ago, you told yourself that you should look into updating a particular piece of software on your computer. You wonder if you should do it now, or later. Youre now back at your desk; what do you start with ? As you have understood, in our daily life, the number of tasks we have to do can easily become very large, and they can concern many different aspects of our life: our house, our finances, our friends, our pets, our food, our work, our hobbies, our computer tools, and so on. Keeping track of everything that needs to be done in all these different aspects of our lives is extremely complicated in an adult life, which includes many responsibilities. In particular, there is the question of priority: when we have many tasks to do, which ones should we start with? This question of priority for our tasks can be difficult to answer. How do you know if fixing the pants is a higher priority than everything else you have to do? To find out, you would have to compare, one by one, all the tasks you have to do, and compare them together until you determine where your pants repair ranks, and whether you should do it today or tomorrow. This takes a lot of time and energy, especially when you are hesitating between many different tasks! This is where the inbox for tasks comes in. Just like an inbox for your e-mails, this one will allow you to quickly see which tasks should be prioritized, but also to integrate new ones effortlessly. This would leave you much more time to work on your tasks, and will leave you with more peace of mind. No more wondering do I remember everything? or did I lose a paper with my list on it? Setting up a task inbox To set up a taskbox, you simply need a software that allows you to : Quickly add a task to your task box Associate a priority to a task, with enough nuance to be able to distinguish between them (just being able to distinguish a task as important or not will certainly not be enough) Sort tasks by priority See your tasks even when you are not in front of your computer (by synchronizing with your phone) [Optionally] Allows you to distinguish tasks from different aspects of your life (its not mandatory, but it allows you to better find your way around; but also to use the P.A.R.A method!) Of course, a free open-source software that ticks all these boxes is Nextcloud Tasks, which we saw earlier. Indeed, this one allows you to associate a priority from 1 to 10 to your tasks! But others exist, and can be used. Once you have chosen your software, you will just have to define categories or lists of tasks (as we have seen in the Nextcloud section and the section on the P.A.R.A method) to then start using your inbox. Each time you add a task to it, simply add a priority to it. When you wonder what you should do, simply sort your tasks by priority so you can see the most important ones right away.  You can also make a to do list in which you can put the tasks you would like to work on today! Exercises During these exercises, we will use Nextcloud Tasks as inbox for your tasks. You can however use another software for this, like Vikunja ! 1. Preparing your inbox For this exercise, I refer you to the exercise 1 of the section on the P.A.R.A method, which proposes to set up different lists of tasks according to the different aspects of your life. 2. Add tasks to your inbox. Go to Nextcloud Tasks. In the Family task list, add the tasks Call Mom, Congratulate Noémie on her graduation, and Send an email to Thomas. Click on each of these tasks in turn. Give them each a priority, respectively: 2, 4, and 6. At the top right of the task list, find the button that allows you to sort the tasks by priority. In the Friends task list, add the tasks Find out which escape game to play with Bastien, Ask about Maëlie, Play a video game with Lucie, Send a letter to Julia and Share the open-source and organization workshop with all my friends. Give them priorities 2, 6, 6, 4 and 1 respectively. In the Finances task list, add the tasks Make a financial statement for the month and Contact my bank about last Sundays debit, with priorities 3 and 2 respectively. In the Work task list, add the tasks Have a meeting with Laurence, Put water in the plants in the office, Send the important file to Jack, Tidy up my desk, Bring back tea for the breaks, Send an email to Catherine, and Prepare the presentation for next Monday. Give them priority 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5 and 2 respectively. 3. View the tasks in your inbox to select the ones to do Go to Nextcloud Tasks. Create a new to-do list named To Do Today. In the left menu to choose a to-do list, go to the All Tasks smart list Look at the contents of your different to-do lists by scrolling down a little at a time. Select the highest priority and most relevant tasks to do today, by dragging and dropping them into the To Do Today task list in the left-hand menu. Go to your To Do Today task list. Use the task sorting button at the top right of the list to sort the tasks manually. Move the tasks by clicking on them to arrange them in the order you would like to do them today. "],["10-example.html", "An example of combining all these tools and methods", " An example of combining all these tools and methods Weve now seen four different pieces of software that help with organization - Joplin, Zotero, Zettlr and Nextcloud. Weve also gone over three different organizational methods - the Zettelkasten, the P.A.R.A method and the inbox, and youve probably already figured out how these software programs can be used with these different methods. You have also started to experiment the interactions between these 3 methods, which are not mutually exclusive, as they can complement each other. So I propose you a small summary by presenting you an example of combination of these softwares and these methods together. The global structure : the P.A.R.A method The P.A.R.A method defines the global structure of this example. To understand it better, I refer you to the section on the P.A.R.A method. Thus, 4 softwares are used: Nextcloud Deck (which contains data related to projects, in the form of Kanban tables) Nextcloud Tasks (which contains data related to areas of responsibility, in the form of tasks to check) Joplin (which contains notes related to projects, responsibility areas, but also to resources and archives) Nextcloud Files (which contains files related to projects, responsibility areas, resources and archives) The organization of the software could be represented as follows: Resource management: The Zettelkasten Within the global structure defined by the P.A.R.A method, it is possible to insert the Zettelkasten as a way to structure the resources on the subjects which interest us. Joplin will take care of this task, and will allow us to store our resources in the form of a Zettelkasten in this example. For more details on how a Zettelkasten is structured and works, I refer you to the section about it. Task management : the inbox Finally, the tasks defined for the different areas of responsibility of the P.A.R.A method (here in Nextcloud Tasks), but also those defined for our different projects (here in Nextcloud Deck) can be managed like an inbox. Thus, all tasks in Nextcloud Tasks and cards in Nextcloud Deck can be associated with priorities, and then be sorted by priority to quickly visualize which tasks must be done. To learn more about managing tasks like an inbox, I refer you to the section on this method. Managing references in resources: Zotero and Joplins BibTex plugin Within the Zettlekasten itself, or in other notes that concern your projects or areas of responsibility, you can insert bibliographic references using Zotero and Joplin. This way, you will have clean and referenced documents without having to manage a reference database by hand (which can be very complicated). For more information on how to use these two softwares, I refer you to their respective sections. Exporting documents in markdown with Joplin Joplin can also act as a good exporter of markdown documents. Although Joplin is able to export your markdown notes in .pdf or .html format, other programs (like Pandoc or Zettlr) are able to do so in a wider range of formats, and also to add references. Summary graph In the end, here is the structure of this example, through the different software used: "],["11-final_word.html", "Final word Some habits to develop Some other software to try Thank you!", " Final word Thank you very much for attending this workshop! I hope you have enjoyed it. I would like to leave you with a few words before we finish this workshop. First of all, remember that all the software you may have discovered today is totally free! However, they all represent many, many hours of work for the people who developed them. So I recommend you to make a small donation to them if you have the financial opportunity, and if you start using these softwares. Just go to their respective websites and follow the instructions. Also, Id like to leave you a little link to my GitHub page, if youre curious to discover my other projects, or the tools I develop. Finally, Id like to leave you with a few other tips to increase your productivity on top of what weve seen today, as well as some other software to try by yourself. Some habits to develop The Pomodoro method to take care of your eyes by getting off the screen at regular intervals, but also to get into a rhythm where you are focused on your work. This is a method that has helped me tremendously to become more productive, and I use it daily. There are many programs that allow you to use it, and I personally use Pomotroid. Mindfulness meditation can help you to take care of your emotions, but also to better focus on your work. It is a non-religious meditation which aims to train the mind to become aware of its emotional state, and to be able to refocus on certain stimuli in particular. It is now recommended in some psychological therapies, and some scientific studies on the subject seem to show that it has an effect on well-being and stress reduction. Many applications exist on the phone to start practicing it, but I personally recommend the book and recordings of Christophe André on the subject. However, it might not be recommended for people who have experienced psychological trauma; dont hesitate to talk to a psychologist before starting. Finally, I recommend to not neglect your workspace, especially if you spend your day in front of a computer. Choose the right place, a good chair, and consider putting bias lighting behind your screen to make it easier on your eyes. Keep your desk clean, and consider having a more minimalist style where everything you dont need at any given time is tucked away and hidden, to limit what you have in your line of sight. Some other software to try In addition to the software we have seen today, I also recommend : Zettlr, an Academic Markdown document editor that has complementary functions to those of Joplin. Thunderbird, a mail manager that adapts to any mailbox, and allows to have them all in the same place. Libreoffice, an office software suite to replace Microsoft Office. Thank you! Good luck with your work. I sincerely hope that these discoveries will help you in your work. Dont hesitate to share the workshop with your colleagues or friends; it is made for that! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to having you as a reader again. Clément "]]
